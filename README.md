# Amazon-Product-Review-NLP

This is an excerpt from my group project materials for Machine Learning and Statistical Data Analysis (COSC 274). The goal of the project was to train a classifier to successfully predict an Amazon product's rating as "awesome" or not (defined as >4.5 stars) based upon its reviews. Project collaborators include YB Choi, Ji-Qing Chen, and Shan-Chang Lin.

The project dataset is a collection of Toys and Games product reviews from Amazon and is not included in this repo because of its very large file size. You can retrieve this data from https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html
